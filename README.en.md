[中文版 README](./README.md)

###This is an upgrade of [Up Database](http://www.github.com/UncP/Up_Database)

###Current Version 0.1.0

####Goals
- Faster than Up Database at million level data insertion and deletion
- Module, easy-to-extend functionality
- Implement the feature of ACID

####Features
- More simplified syntax [pear syntax](./pear_syntax)
- More excellent speed

###Version Information
####Test Data 1000000 tuples, 80 bytes/tuple
	Consist of: key  16  bytes,  value  64  bytes

* Version 0.1.0
	- Insertion speed			``` 328000 tuples/second ```
	- Deletion speed			``` 204000 tuples/second ```


###TODO
- [ ] insert, select, delete operation


***

###Special Version 0.1.0
It is a non-relational database written in C, which consists of 6 modules,
16 files and has less than 2000 lines of code.
The core parts **btree.c** and **page.c** have less than 800 lines of codes.
Though it does not has the ACID features of a database, it is small,
its syntax is simple, it has excellent speed and supports 10 million level
data insertion and deletion.

pear v0.1.0 enables you to get a quick understanding of the architecture of
a database and its concrete implementation.
If you are interested in this special version of pear,
`git clone https://github.com/UncP/pear.git`
`cd pear/src`
`make && python ../generate_data.py && ./run`
a million tuples of test data will be generated by python script, python 2.7
or >= 3.5. The run script can change the program arguments, *put* represents the
tuples of data to insert, each put represents 10000 tuples, *drop* represents the
tuples of data to delete.

Enjoy !
